## Overview of SDLC

\*\*\*This is the most essential discussion, watch it every time.

In this discussion teaches how to break down a mega software development into small parts. It helps to analyze software development more accurately.

```bash
SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

There are 5 steps of SDLC. They are -

1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Maintenance

```

**The people who will cover the steps -**

1. Analyze: Product owner, Project manager, Business analyst, CTO
2. Design: System architect, UI/UX designer
3. Development: Frontend developer, backend developer
4. Testing: Solutions architect, QA engineer, tester
5. Deployment: Data Administrator, DevOps
6. Maintenance: Users, support managers, testers, developers

**While analyzing there need to be created some documents. They are** -

1. Product Requirement Document (PRD)
2. Business Requirement Document (BRD)
3. Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
4. Functional Requirement Document (FRD)

**While designing there need to be created some documents. They are -**

1. High-Level Design Document
2. Low-Level Design Document
3. Database Schema

**While testing there need to be created some documents. They are -**

1. Test Plan
2. Test Case
3. Test Scripts
4. Defect Reports

**While deploying there need to be created some documents. They are -**

1. Release Notes
2. Installation Guides
3. Configuration Guides

**While maintenance there need to be created some documents. They are -**

1. Change Request Notes
2. Bug Reports
3. Patch Release

**There are minimal steps that should be followed to develop software -**

1. Requirement Analysis
2. ERD Diagram
3. API End Points
4. Wire Frame (Interface UI)
